# Lookup module

## Overview

`Kora.lookup` resolves GTA hash values to canonical vehicle, ped, object, weapon,
weapon-component, and pickup names on both the client and server. Base records
come from compact generated Lua indexes and each namespace is loaded only on
its first use. Loaded indexes and materialized records remain cached for the
lifetime of kora_lib; there is no SQL, expiry, or periodic scan.

The generated catalog is pinned to
[`DurtyFree/gta-v-data-dumps@b65684e`](https://github.com/DurtyFree/gta-v-data-dumps/tree/b65684e00f689fdec405c5f1055322c802d3c895),
GTA build `v3717.0 (Online 1.72) [DLC: mp2025_02_g9ec]`. Its object namespace
covers the upstream list of creatable objects, not every hidden map archetype.
Exact provenance and counts live in `modules/lookup/data/source.json`.

## API

```lua
local record, reason, candidates = Kora.lookup.get('vehicle', hash)

Kora.lookup.model(value, kind)       -- kind: vehicle, ped, or object
Kora.lookup.model(value)             -- searches all three model namespaces
Kora.lookup.weapon(value)
Kora.lookup.weaponComponent(value)
Kora.lookup.pickup(value)

Kora.lookup.preload()                -- every base namespace
Kora.lookup.preload({ 'vehicle', 'weapon' })
Kora.lookup.ready()
Kora.lookup.awaitReady(10000)       -- finite, non-negative timeout in ms
```

`awaitReady` defaults to 10 seconds only when its timeout is omitted; an
explicit timeout must be a non-negative integer.

`preload` accepts one namespace string or a dense array of valid namespace
strings. Invalid or sparse arrays are rejected instead of being treated as an
empty preload request.

`value` may be a signed or unsigned integer, a decimal string, a hexadecimal
string, or a case-insensitive canonical name. Every hash is normalized to its
unsigned 32-bit representation. Invalid namespaces, empty values, malformed
hexadecimal hashes, non-integral numbers, and values outside the 32-bit range
raise an assertion.

Successful calls return a `QBLookupRecord`. A miss returns one of:

- `nil, 'catalog_pending'` while the client is still receiving the custom
  catalog;
- `nil, 'not_found'` after the custom catalog is ready; or
- `nil, 'ambiguous', candidates` when different canonical names share a hash.

Base hits are available even while the custom catalog is pending. An untyped
`model` call also treats a hash found in more than one model namespace as
ambiguous.

## Records

```lua
{
    namespace = 'vehicle',
    hash = 3078201489,             -- unsigned
    signedHash = -1216765807,
    hexHash = '0xB779A091',
    name = 'adder',
    label = 'Adder',
    labelKey = 'ADDER',
    category = 'SUPER',
    dlc = 'TitleUpdate',
    source = 'base',               -- base, custom, or base+custom
    resources = nil,               -- sorted custom contributors when present
    metadata = {
        class = 'SUPER',
        manufacturer = 'TRUFFADE',
        type = 'CAR',
        seats = 2,
    },
}
```

Other namespace metadata fields are `pedType`; weapon `modelName` and
`damageType`; component `weaponNames`, `componentType`, and `attachBone`; and
pickup `modelName`. Records are read-only by contract. Copy a record before
changing it so a mutation does not alter the process-wide cache.

## Custom resources

At server startup kora_lib scans discovered resources once. It checks streamed
`.ydr` names, readable text `.ytyp` archetypes, and known vehicle, ped, weapon,
and component metadata. Binary `.ytyp` and ambiguous `.yft` files are skipped
with a warning because their model kind cannot safely be inferred from the
filename alone.

A resource can supply `kora_lib.lookup.json` for explicit additions, enrichment,
or exclusions (the deprecated name `qblib.lookup.json` is still read when the new
file is absent):

```json
{
  "entries": [
    {
      "namespace": "vehicle",
      "name": "my_custom_car",
      "label": "Custom Car",
      "category": "sports",
      "metadata": {
        "class": "sports",
        "manufacturer": "MYMAKE",
        "type": "car",
        "seats": 2
      }
    },
    {
      "namespace": "object",
      "name": "my_custom_prop",
      "hash": "0xF064FDEE"
    }
  ],
  "exclude": [
    { "namespace": "object", "name": "filename_that_is_not_an_object" }
  ]
}
```

`namespace` and `name` are required. If `hash` is present it must equal the
name's JOAAT value; a mismatched entry is rejected. Common optional fields are
`label`, `labelKey`, `category`, and `dlc`. Metadata is namespace-specific and
restricted to the fields documented above.

Identical namespace/hash/name records are merged and retain a sorted list of
contributing resources. Different names with the same hash remain separate
collision candidates. Explicit entries take precedence while retaining
inferred fields they do not replace.

Only the custom overlay is sent to clients. It is split into versioned batches
below 24 KiB and published atomically after every batch arrives; out-of-order,
duplicate, and stale batches are harmless. Clients retry the request after the
secure kora_lib event handshake until the snapshot is ready.

The scan runs only when kora_lib starts and yields between resources, so a large
custom-resource set does not hold one long server tick. Each resource is capped
at 4,096 directory entries; kora_lib warns and skips the remainder rather than
letting a malformed or unusually large resource extend startup indefinitely.
Use `kora_lib.lookup.json` for assets beyond that limit. Restart kora_lib after
installing, removing, or changing a custom resource. The scanner writes no
runtime files.

## Regenerating base data

From the kora_lib resource root:

```sh
node tools/lookup/generate.mjs
node tools/lookup/generate.mjs --check
node --test tools/lookup/generate.test.mjs
```

The generator downloads only the pinned upstream revision, validates every
catalog hash against JOAAT, detects collisions, extracts curated fields, sorts
all numeric keys, and writes the six Lua bundles plus the source manifest. Use
`--input <directory>` to regenerate from an already-downloaded copy containing
the five files named in `source.json`.
